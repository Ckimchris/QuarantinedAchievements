## Quarantined Achievements
An image based compilation website to display a timeline of events. The site was created as a memorial to every media and personal achievement undertaken during the COVID-19 quarantine.

The app is built with react. The timeline component utilizes a data object model and a mapping function in order to parse through each individual object and generate them as new components for the timeline. It was built for ease for continuous integration allowing me to easily add and adjust images, colors, text, and tags for each and every new addition to the timeline.
